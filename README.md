### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hi my name is R but my friends call me Rick. Iâ€™m a software engineer that specializes in full-stack web development. 

I love coding and learning about new languages and technologies. I enjoy building and modding my own personal computers and updating my friends computers when needed. I also have a passion for creative writing and self-published my first novel in 2009. [Phases of Reason] (https://www.amazon.com/Phases-Reason-Eight-Ball-Jarrett-Dowd/dp/1442149108)
